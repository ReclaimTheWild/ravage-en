# Guardians

Guardians are robots built by the Ancients. While Guardians were originally designed to fight Calamity Ganon, many of them were instead corrupted by it. Only those few Guardians hidden in Shrines to test would-be Heroes were saved from this fate.

## Guardian Lore

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Guardians are known to guard places the Ancients found important, hence their name. If you should ever encounter a Guardian, you should leave that place immediately… or delve deeper, to see why they would keep the place guarded.

### Adept (DC 13)

Calamity Ganon was able to infect and take over all the Guardians that were set against it. There are also reports of Ganon’s power taking up Guardian materials to take on temporary, deadly form. Some scholars theorize that this means that the two share some deeper connection.

### Expert (DC 16)

Guardians were originally invented by the Sheikah, 10,000 years ago. They were built to defend against Calamity Ganon’s first coming – and they succeeded.

### Impressive (DC 19)

Not all Guardians were possessed by Ganon’s Malice during the Calamity. Those that were in Sheikah Shrines and other protected places were kept safe, their programming still intact.

### Heroic (DC 22)

In some Ancient texts, they speak of incredible giant Octoroks inspiring the form of Guardians. Scholars still debate whether this is poetic language, or if there were actually giant Octoroks that roamed the world 10,000 years ago.

### Legendary (DC 25)

Despite the ancient Sheikah’s incredible skill, knowledge, and resources, they never made a Guardian capable of independent thought… right?
