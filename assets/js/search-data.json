Darknuts are smart enough to form coordinated groups, make plans, and even command lesser creatures. This makes them dangerous not only as frontline combatants, but also as generals and elite strike forces. However, as Darknut armor absorbs those blows, it tends to come loose and fall off. This fatal weakness is shared by all their ilk, making any fight with a Darknut a battle of attrition – one that Heroes might be able to turn to their advantage.

Magtails like to run up to foes and either slice them up, or attempt to grab them, with their pincers. They may then try to drag their grappled prey back down into the lava, or just squeeze them until they pop. Once a Magtail uses Goron Goroll, it will not unroll until killed or left alive. This can make them useful weights for switches and puzzles. ",

Their Defense, Evasion, and the damage and accuracy of their attacks are all presented with that default equipment in mind. However, that doesn’t mean that those foes must use that default equipment. Whenever a foe’s default equipment is not presented as Natural equipment, it’s ripe for changing out. It’s a quick and easy way to make one type of enemy feel a bit more varied, rather than a horde of faceless mooks. This is particularly handy when the Heroes are fighting lots of similar monsters: for instance, if the Heroes are fighting through a bandit hideout, the various Brigands they fight might be using different equipment. Perhaps some of them are caught unawares, without their armor. Some of them might have different weapons, or additional tools, changing their stats and tactics. And of course, perhaps some lucky or powerful foe is using an enchanted weapon, making them even more of a threat than their fellows. ",

However, we have not included such variants in this book, as that would bloat its size fivefold.

To quickly increase a foe’s Rank by one: . | Increase about half of their Traits (their highest or most important Traits) by 2. | Increase their remaining Traits by 1. | Increase their Defense by… o Civilian: +1 o Light or Medium: +2 o Heavy: +3 o Extreme: +4 o Impervious: +8 | Increase their Weapons’ Attack by +3. | Adjust the foe’s Concentration, Evasion, Vitality, Health, Magic, and Stamina. | . …and, optionally: . | …give the foe a new Spell or Technique. | …Play the foe more intelligently (using more Reactions and Combat Maneuvers, better tactics, or specially-tweaked gear). | . To quickly decrease a foe’s Rank by one: . | Reduce half of their Traits (their highest or most important Traits) by 2. (Min. 1) | Reduce remaining Traits by 1. (Min. 0) | Reduce their Defense, per the above. | Worsen all equipment by one Rank. | Adjust the foe’s Concentration, Evasion, Vitality, Health, Magic, and Stamina. | .

This allows them to easily make a bigger, meaner version of a foe, giving even a whole team of Heroes a mighty threat to face. To turn a foe into a Heavy, Mini-Boss, or Boss, do the following: . | Apply the appropriate Order to the monster, with all of its benefits. (This increases the amount of HP, MP, and SP that the foe has, as well as the amount of Materials or loot it drops.) | Consider giving the foe at least one additional Spell or Technique that its lesser brethren don’t have. Mini-Bosses and Bosses should probably get more than one extra trick. | If you’re making the foe into a Mini-Boss or Boss, give the foe a Weak Point for the Heroes to discover and exploit. | Consider giving the foe an additional, helpful Passive or two. You should especially consider Passives that work with (or are shut down by) the foe’s Weak Point. | Often, these supercharged foes are also super-sized. Consider increasing the foe’s Size by one or more steps. | . Finally, don’t forget that Bosses often have their own, specially-designed room that serves as their battle arena. Consider what might help the Boss defend itself – and what might help Heroes defeat it – when designing such a room. ",
