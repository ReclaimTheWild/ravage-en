# Darknuts

Darknuts are the nigh-indestructible knights in many an evil army. Though renowned for their skill with a weapon and their exceptional durability, few have seen a Darknut’s true appearance beneath their armored visage.  
Some think them demons, while other tales speak of dog-like appearances, or fallen warriors trapped in animate armor.

Darknuts are smart enough to form coordinated groups, make plans, and even command lesser creatures. This makes them dangerous not only as frontline combatants, but also as generals and elite strike forces. 

However, as Darknut armor absorbs those blows, it tends to come loose and fall off. This fatal weakness is shared by all their ilk, making any fight with a Darknut a battle of attrition – one that Heroes might be able to turn to their advantage.

Ask any experienced Hero – Darknuts are not to be trifled with. Even a lone Darknut is a respectable, honorable challenge.
