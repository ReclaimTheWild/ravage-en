# Yiga

The Yiga are a clan of evil ninjas, often resorting to theft, deception, and cold-blooded murder. They see Calamity Ganon as the ultimate end of the battle of good versus evil, and will stop at nothing to see him restored and victorious.

Nothing, that is… except a tasty banana.

The Yiga lead a life of secrecy, and always wear a mask when with other Yiga. This way, no one knows anyone’s true face – so if captured and tortured, they can’t reveal anyone’s true identity.
