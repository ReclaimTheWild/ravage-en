# Mothula

Mothula is a giant insect, dangerous and beautiful in equal measure. They rule the dark, forgotten places in forests and caverns. Though not actually all that deadly on their own, Mothula rely on an assortment of insect minions and metallic traps in their lair to deal with intruders and would-be bug-swatters.
