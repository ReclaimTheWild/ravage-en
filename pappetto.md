# Pappetto

Pappetto are animated puppets, called to life by strange magic. They dance and cavort in a way that seems joyful, but their unending smiles seem more sinister when they near…

## Pappetto Lore

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Pappetto can be heard before they’re seen, their joints jangling like wooden windchimes. Beware the sounds of strange music, cackling, and hollow wood clanging!

### Adept (DC 13) 

Rumor is that Pappetto were once people, who got lost in the forest or cursed by a Skull Kid. Whether that’s true or not, perhaps only they know…

### Expert (DC 16)

Pappetto are not always just abandoned cursed objects – sometimes, wizards will use Pappetto as their minions, pulling their strings directly. Beware if a troupe of Pappetto seem to act with purpose, or seek to parlay.
