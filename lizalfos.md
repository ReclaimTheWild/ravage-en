# Lizalfos

Primitive lizard-men, Lizalfos are often found in caverns, volcanos, and other hot, dry places. They use metal arms and armor, a natural flame-breath, and their natural agility to protect themselves – and to viciously defend their territory from interlopers.

They sometimes conduct raids on towns, particularly when there’s useful ore or other materials to be gotten. However, they tend not to attack in colder climes – Lizalfos have no defense against snow and ice.

Because Lizalfos are agile creatures who can easily jump away from an approaching foe, Heroes may need to use other methods to get in close. Try Slowing, Halting, or knocking a Lizalfos Off-Balance – or use a Hookshot or some other means to bring them to you!
