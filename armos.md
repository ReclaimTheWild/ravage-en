# Armos

Stone statues crudely made to resemble ancient knights. Their rocky exterior makes them particularly durable opponents. Though clumsy, they can move as fast as any Hero when roused to action. However, Armos cannot rouse themselves to action: they only spring into action when touched, or activated *en masse* by some mechanism.

## Armos Lore

### Novice (DC 7)

Wherever there are ancient ruins, there might be Armos. Mothers often warn their children to never touch a statue they don’t know for sure is inanimate.

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Armos may be tough, but they aren’t wise of agile. Tricks, traps, and status ailments can all stop an Armos.

### Adept (DC 13)

Armos are mechanical marvels, their internal contraptions finely-tuned clockwork. Some scholars speculate they may be prototype Guardians.
