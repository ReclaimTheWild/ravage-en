# Keese

A common bat-like monster – and reviled world-wide as annoyances – Keese live in the shadows of belfries, forests, and the upper reaches of cavernous rooms. 

Keese are night-hunters, hanging from the ceiling until they sense a creature moving below them. Unable to distinguish a small Critter from a stout Hero, they will attack whatever creature has caught their attention until swatted down, hampering their accuracy against the foes that truly threaten them.

## Keese Lore

### Effortless (DC 4)

Keese are a common threat, even to villagers in their homes. To avoid them, be sure to clean your attic twice a year, and avoid being outdoors at night.

### Novice (DC 7)

If you have a Keese infestation, a simple way to draw them out is to tie some bait (like a lively Critter or juicy hunk of meat) onto a string, toss the bait into the room the Keese inhabit, and wiggle it with a few swift tugs. When the Keese swoop down to feast, either lead them 
outside (taking care not to be seen by them as you do so), or strike them down.

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Keese seem to have a natural affinity for containing elemental power, as evidenced by the wide array of elementally-typed Keese in the world. Wizards have long used their wings and eyeballs as ingredients in their potions, but a few have experimented with them as a way to generate large amounts of elemental energy… by breeding vast colonies of Keese, and keeping them contained and ravenous.
