# Moblin

Moblins are large, muscular animal-men, usually based on bulldogs or pigs. They often serve as trusted servants of evil forces, forming a feared, brutish infantry. More brawn than brain, they are easily outwitted – but not so easily outfought.

Moblin are known to wield whatever weapons may be at hand, and are skilled in the use of any martial weapon. For most Moblins, this means they’ll be using simple, poorly-forged arms that they or their clan has made. However, beware the Moblin who finds themselves in unusual circumstances, or has been kitted out by some unseen benefactor! Their items may be enchanted, specially-made, or otherwise exceptionally potent.

## Moblin Lore

### Novice (DC 7)

Moblins are big, hulking brutes, but easily tricked. Many a tale has been told of clever Heroes tricking Moblins into letting them pass, surrendering to them, or even joining them in their quest.

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Some Moblin have the countenance of pigs, others of bulldogs. No one’s quite sure why, or how well these two subspecies get along with one another.

### Adept (DC 13)

Not all Moblins are evil –a rare few just want to live in solitude and peace. These Moblins are known to bribe those who stumble into their dens, in an attempt to buy their silence.

### Expert (DC 16)

Moblins may be dim-witted, but archaeological evidence suggests that they are one of the oldest races in Hyrule, dating back well before the first Calamity.
