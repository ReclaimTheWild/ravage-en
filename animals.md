# Animals

Throughout Hyrule and the lands beyond its borders, various animals populate the countryside. They might live with townspeople in their homes or farms, or populate the countryside as wild and untamed beasts. Some might be mundane, and others a little bit more magical.

## ...Of Another Color

Sometimes, animals display curious colors, distinct from most of their species. In many heroic tales, this indicates the animal is destined for a great fate, such as becoming a Hero’s companion. Such animals might have higher Traits than their standard siblings, access to unexpected skills or magical powers, or even the capacity to talk. Whether these rarities manifest or not, it’s likely worth a Hero’s time to follow animals of another color.
