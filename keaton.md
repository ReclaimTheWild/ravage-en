# Keaton

Keaton are curious fey spirit-creatures, yellow foxes with three black-tipped tails. Able to speak and read with great skill, Keatons are said to grant gifts to those who can answer their riddles.

## Keaton Lore

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Keaton are kind spirits, but rarely seen. The stories say that, if you meet one, you should always speak the truth to it, and answer its questions as best you can. Sometimes, they leave gifts for those they favor.

### Adept (DC 13)

Keaton are mystical, perhaps otherworldly fey foxes. They enjoy watching average mortals in their average lives, and find the most trivial of facts fascinating – but when asked why, Keatons just smirk and chuckle.

### Expert (DC 16)

Keatons can easily disguise themselves as mortals, though sometimes their guise slips, and their tails hang free. Inscrutable to most, Keatons can tell one another apart by the sheen of their tails.

## Playing a Keaton

Keaton are strange creatures, but nothing says they can’t decide to play Hero for a generation or two. If you wish to play as a Keaton, you might consider using either the Demon or Talking Animal race – or you can use the solution presented here.

*Curious, inquisitive, and ever-watchful,*  
*Skillfully playing the only game that matters.*

Average Height: 3’ 6” – 6’ 0”  
Average Weight: 80 – 150 lbs.  
Lifespan: Unknown (potentially infinite)  
Fur colors: Black, Brown (tips), White, Yellow  
Eye colors: Black  

**Play a Keaton if you want…**
- …To be a subtle, patient gamester.
- …To be mysterious, magical, and fey.
- …To see and hear what no one else can.
- …To control a situation through words and misdirection, rather than violence.

**Vulnerability**: Dark

**Bonuses:**

- You have both Scent-Sense and Magic Sense. However, your other senses arepoor – when using Perception on things neither magical nor odiferous, you suffer a -2 penalty to the roll.
- You may speak with, and understand, Natural creatures of Limited intelligence (like cats, dogs, and horses). This does not mean they automatically want to speak with you, or that they will tell you the truth. 
- You gain the Impa’s Disguise spell.
- You gain one of the following Spells for free: Fairy Fire, Lens of Truth, Keaton’s Quiz, or Vanish. (Fairy Fire and Keaton’s Quiz may be purchased later, for 3 Tokens each.)

Most Keatons react to the day-to-day lives of normal people just like they react to high adventure and dangerous situations: quiet interest, a smirk, and a desire to learn more.

Keatons particularly enjoy anything that makes them have to think, or recall facts. They offer riddles, trivia, and quizzes to one another as gentle tests and jabs, and relish a fresh puzzle or mystery.

It’s rare for Keatons to be angered, but pulling on their tail is a sure way to get on one’s bad side. If you do enrage a Keaton, expect a thorough revenge, served cold.  
Keatons are not above puckish pranks, and they have the patience, magic, and skills to ruin your day, your reputation, or your life.
