# Beetles

Large insects with hard shells, Beetles are durable and tenacious foes. It is nearly impossible for a Hero to crack their shells with brute force – instead, they must use their wits to best these bugs.

## Beetle Lore

### Effortless (DC 4)

All Beetles have a hard, durable shell. Brute force alone is rarely enough to deal with them.

### Novice (DC 7)

Beetles large and small prefer to live underground. The smaller ones just dig a tiny hole, but the big ones prefer caves and abandoned structures. It’s rare indeed to see a Beetle in the open sunlight.

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Ancient dungeon-builders often left small entrances for Beetles in their trap-filled tombs, particularly in rooms with pits, spikes, or other dangerous terrain. If you find yourself in a dungeon, fighting Beetles, and the room seems otherwise safe – beware, for the other shoe may yet drop.

### Adept (DC 13)

Zoro Beetles are a common nuisance, but be on the lookout for when they’re amassed in a mound of rich, loamy dirt. That often indicates a spot where someone buried something; the Beetles have merely taken advantage of the loosened dirt to build a nest.
