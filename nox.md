# Nox

Nox are cycloptic giants, easily recognizable from their highly developed musculature and the single, huge eyeball that dominates their faces. They live in the woods, hills, and lonely places of the world, valuing solitude for their long, sun-drenched naps.

Hinox are the biggest, and most famous, type of Nox – each a giant to rival some mountains. Bombnox are less famous, and while they’re also not quite as big or strong, they can be just as dangerous in a group.

## Nox Lore

### Adept (DC 13)

The incredible strength of the Nox is well-known, and well-feared. Hyrule Castle once had to weather a siege from Nox forces, and though the Nox lost that fight, it took a dozen years to rebuild the castle walls after the damage the Nox did.

### Expert (DC 16)

While nobody has ever seen how Bombnox create their bombs, theories abound. Some say they secretly mine the mineral-rich hills they live on; others believe they have perfected the Create Ammunition spell in some way.

### Impressive (DC 19)

Gorons tell of Heroes testing their strength by attempting to wrestle a Hinox. They say that a certain valley was created when one particularly strong Hero managed to suplex a Hinox into submission.
