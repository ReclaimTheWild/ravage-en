# Stalfos

Stalfos are skeletal foes, found all over Hyrule. They commonly pop up from their graves during the night, and can prove difficult to put down.

## Stalfos Lore

### Novice (DC 7)

Stalfos’ bones come from fallen travelers. The stronger the deceased, the stronger the resultant Stalfos.

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Stalfos prefer dark and shaded places, or to come out at night. While sunlight does not harm them, they still cower at the sight of it.

### Adept (DC 13)

Stalfos aren’t always active. Sometimes, they go dormant, resting as a conspicuous pile of bones, or burying their bodies in the dirt so that only their head remains visible. 

### Expert (DC 16)

Travelers tell rumors of the Kingdom of Ikana, a once-great country, now populated entirely by Stalfos and other undead. Some say they fought a war so heinous, and so full of hatred, that the dead continue to fight it still.
