# Talus

Talus are huge stone behemoths, without face or mind of any kind. They sleep away the ages, looking like a boulder or hill – until someone rouses them. Then, they rise up, and proceed to smash anything nearby, before settling down for a decades’ nap.

Pebblits, the young form of a Talus, can be found in those same environs. Wherever you see more than a few Pebblit, be wary – you might already be standing on a Talus.
