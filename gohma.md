# Gohma

Gohma are insect-like creatures, with a huge eye dominating their body. They skitter sideways, and can even climb up walls, waiting in the shadows for their prey. They prefer to live in dark, quiet, open places.

## Gohma Lore

### Novice (DC 7)

Gohma are one of the most common large-scale monsters a Hero might face. They breed quickly and plentifully, and can make their home in most any dark environ. The surest way to prevent a Gohma Larva from making its home in your basement is to properly seal and light it.

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Gohma are a common infestation in large trees, tunneling into the tree trunk and using a hollowed-out space as a home. The bigger the tree, the bigger the Gohma can become before it must leave to find a new home. 

### Adept (DC 13)

As Gohma age, they become larger and more powerful. They can even grow additional body segments, changing from their traditional ‘arachnid’ body to a more ‘centipede’-like form. The larger, longer, or more segmented a Gohma, the more powerful and dangerous it is.
