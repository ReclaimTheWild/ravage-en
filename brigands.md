# Brigands

In any adventure, Heroes are likely to encounter brigands on the road. Foul-smelling and foul-tempered, the typical brigand runs in a small gang of ne’er-do-wells who seek wealth and ease by taking from others. They might accost travelers, attempt to kidnap people, or be put to work by some more nefarious, powerful evil force. 

Brigands never want to start a fair fight. They prefer to spring upon unwary travelers, or gang up on individuals in a bar brawl. They also make use of simple traps, like tripwires, nets, or pitfalls, when setting up an ambush.

## Brigand Lore

### Effortless (DC 4)

Brigands can be found on almost anywhere – on the roads between towns, in the back alleys of cities, or hiding out in caves. They’re smarter than monsters, so be wary!

### Novice (DC 7) 

Brigands want to get the most wealth they can for the least risk they can, so they tend to gang up on weak targets. If you’re fighting Brigands, it would be wise to follow suit. 

### Journeyman (DC 10)

When two gangs of Brigands fight, it’s the little people who get hurt most of all. Brigand leaders are often short-sighted enough to burn farms, destroy bridges, or even align themselves with a greater evil, in order to acquire power and resources. 

### Adept (DC 13)

Brigands band together into gangs, often ruled by a single tough leader through barbaric might-is-right law. However, they often serve as a meritocracy – making them an attractive alternative for those living under a despot or in inescapable conditions.
