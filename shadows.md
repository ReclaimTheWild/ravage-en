# Shadows

Shadows are ghostly foes, barely-there baddies built of blackest night. Often able to melt into shadows and sneak past defenses, they share a vulnerability to bright light.

Shadow enemies are often found in dungeons and caverns that utilize light as a puzzle mechanic. They might also appear during eclipses, on particularly dark and stormy nights, or serving a greater foe under the cover of magically-summoned darkness.
