# Bokoblins

Bokoblin are child-sized, pig-headed, and generally seen as a nuisance. Individually weak, they often join up with threats greater than themselves – be it simply a Moblin 
bigger than they are, or a great evil threatening all the land.

Bokoblin are just smart enough to get into trouble: able to capture and tame horses, utilize weapons they stumble across, and even to forge their own (in the eponymous Bokoblin style). This means that no two camps of Bokoblin act quite alike: when facing Bokoblins, don’t get too complacent – even if, half the time, their most recent shenanigans blow up in their face.

## Bokoblin Lore

### Effortless (DC 4)

Bokoblin are common nuisances. Though weak, they can be dangerous in large groups.

### Novice (DC 7)

Bokoblin prefer outdoor, shady areas: forests, beneath cliff overhangs, and the entrance of small caves.  
Their capacity to make fire, forge primitive weapons, and even cook meat, enables them to survive harsh environments.

### Journeyman (DC 10) 

Bokoblin are capable of creating primitive fortifications, consisting of campfires, small look-out towers, and simple wooden barricades. The most organized, well-stocked, and dangerous forts are hewn from the rock, shaped into the form of a giant gaping skull – an intimidating, if primitive, edifice.

### Adept (DC 13) 

Bokoblin rarely have a greater aim than claiming a little more treasure or territory than they already own. If Bokoblins are on the move en masse, they are likely under the command of some greater, more intelligent evil force.
