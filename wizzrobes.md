# Wizzrobes

Wizzrobe are among the most cunning and magically-capable of evil creatures. With faces permanently shrouded in darkness, they disappear and reappear at a whim, casting dangerous magic as easily as Heroes cast aspersions on their annoying tactics.

## Wizzrobe Lore

### Journeyman (DC 10)

Wizzrobes are skilled wizards, known for their most annoying trick: when they focus, they can slightly phase out of existence, becoming hard to track or hit. Wait for the Wizzrobe to manifest itself fully, then unleash a mighty blow while you can.

### Adept (DC 13)

No one has ever seen a Wizzrobe’s face, only their glowing eyes. Some people think they may not have a face at all, being instead an embodiment of magic, or the spirit of some long-lost wizard who delved too deep into arcane mysteries.

### Expert (DC 16)

Some clans of Wizzrobes wear colorful, ornate headgear, resembling a tropical bird’s beak. This may be a way for them to convey personality, making up for their lack of a corporeal face – or perhaps the masks convey some mystical power.
